Modifying an inactive pull request locally
An inactive pull request is one whose owner has either stopped responding, or, more likely, has deleted their fork. If a fork was deleted, the pull request can still be merged. However, if you want to make changes to a pull request and the author is not responding, you'll need to perform some additional steps to update the pull request.
Once a pull request is opened, GitHub stores all of the changes online for you. In other words, commits in a pull request are available in a repository even before the PR is merged. That means you can fetch an open pull request and recreate it as your own.
Anyone can work with a previously opened pull request to continue working on it, test it out, or even open a new pull request with additional changes. However, only collaborators with push access can merge pull requests.
